    <h1>About me</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>My first name is Daniel.</li>
        <li>My current major is computer science.</li>
        <li>My current IP address is 130.64.64.66.</li>
        <li>I grew up right outside Seattle, Washington.</li>
        <li>Something that no one would expect about me: over the 2022 summer
            I was paid to tutor someone in how to build a website, and built my
            first basic HTML website (static page display) when I was 12.
        </li>
        <li>A picture of my favorite place, Snoqualmie Pass where I would
            ski with my family, is included below.</li>
    </ul>
